Pay attention: This is NOT an official Archlinux repository! You probably
should neither trust nor use the packages contained in this repository.

This is a private repo for my own systems to pull pre-built packages from,
therefore packages can and will vanish, get modified or added. Basically
don't rely on anything in here!

If you want to setup your own repository refer to these resources:
